# Request id

A good thing to know is that every request passed through this interceptor, has an id.
**This does not mean that is a unique id**. The id is used in a number of ways, but the
most important is to bind a request to its cache.

The id generation is good enough to generate the same id for theoretically sames requests.
The example of this is a request with `{ baseUrl: 'https://a.com/', url: '/b' }` results
to the same id with `{ url: 'https://a.com/b/' }`.

Also, a custom id can be used to treat two requests as the same.

```js
axios.get('...', {
  id: 'my-custom-id',
  cache: {
    // other properties...
  }
});
```

The [default](src/util/key-generator.ts) id generation can clarify this idea.
